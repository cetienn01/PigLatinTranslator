# PygLatinTranslator

## Pig Latin is a language game, where you move the first letter of the word to the end and add “ay.”
So for example: “Python” becomes “ythonpay.”

To write a Pig Latin translator in Python, here are the steps we’ll need to take:
..1. Ask the user to input a word in English.
..2. Make sure the user entered a valid word.
..3. Convert the word from English to Pig Latin.
..4. Display the translation result.
